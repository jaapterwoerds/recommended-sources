# Collected resources I often refer to
I found the following list of resources worthwile and often reread and rewatch. I often refer friends and colleagues to these sources for various reasons. This repository collects and categorizes these sources together with a small explanations why they're so great. 

## Machine learning
Black box that shit..

[Bob Coecke on QNLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9uSV1YcOy4&t=0s) The content in the Machine learning street talk podcast is of exceptional quality, but this particular episode is beyond epic because of the character of Bob Coecke and the cross section of sciences which come together here: quantum computing, deep learning, natural language processing, category theory and diagrammetic proof theory. Essential material for people who understand that the real science nowadays cross polinates and has a cross sectional frontier with Category Theory as an important enabler.

As a bonus, the grin on the presenter's face during the whole introdutiuon is priceless and worth a study in it's own right. 

## System Design
The overarcing theme here is choose your constraints explicitly and formalize them using the language of universal algebra and category theory.

[Liberties constrain, constrains liberate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqmsQeSzMdw) by Runar

[Axis of abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOI7TJaojTs) by Paul Philips. If I just keep promoting the word adhocicity it will become a word hopefully. 

[Simple made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey. I like his slogan but he seems to be drowning in his own analytical philosphic word soup without coming to anything substantial.

## Proof and type wizardry

[Univalent foundations of mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9RiR9AcXeE) A mathematician talking about why maths needs compilation and continuous intergration. Vladimir Voevodsky is called the father of Homotopy type theory but he seems to be gotten there from the angle of reproducable sience and mathematics. His introduction is about an bug in a groundbraking paper 'Algabraic cycles and higher K theory' which discredited the hole field of motovic cohomology( [from 12 min onwards](https://youtu.be/E9RiR9AcXeE?t=733). Later it turned out there were more bugs ðŸ˜„. The rest of the talk is about bugs in mathematics and what can be done about that.

## Sadly not fiction
These are a collection of my favorite sources of contrarian views. Very wrong, but deliciously so..

# Podcast and series

[Machine learning street talk](https://www.youtube.com/c/MachineLearningStreetTalk) If ever in need of an advanced ML content firehose, look no further than Machine learning street talk. In addition the editing and introductions of the guest and the technical background are exquisitit, really wonderfully crafted and edited.

[Lex Fridman's podcast)(https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman) Lex has a wide array of interesting guests. The reason the podcast is so great is the preparation and genuine interest of the interviewer in the deep questions that occupy the mind the guests.
